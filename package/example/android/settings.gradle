// This way the example app and filament project will use the same folder for compiling RNWC.
// In filament's CMakeList we use "find_package(react-native-worklets-core)", and this finds RNWC
// in the "packages/node_modules" directory, even when being used from the example app.
// Thus we need to make sure that the native library gets compiled in that directory.
