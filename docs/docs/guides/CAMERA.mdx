## The `<Camera />` components

Your 3D scene needs to be projected to a 2D surface, your view. The camera is the "eye" through which you're looking
in the 3D space and which determines how the 3D scene is projected to the 2D surface.

- Only one camera per scene is supported currently
- Only perspective cameras are supported currently

The perspective camera has a 

- Position
- A point in space it looks at
- (An up vector that determines the orientation of the camera, but usually the default is fine)

```tsx
import { Camera } from 'react-native-filament'

<Camera
  position={[0, 0, 10]}
  target={[0, 0, 0]}
/>
```

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/camera-projection.png')} width="70%" />

### Controlling the projection matrix

The camera coordinate system defines the *view space*. The camera points towards its -z axis
and is oriented such that its top side is in the direction of +y, and its right side in the
direction of +x.

There are three parameters that control the projection matrix:

#### `near` plane

- The closest distance from the camera at which objects will be rendered
- Objects closer to the camera than the near plane are clipped and not displayed
- Default is `0.1m`

<details>
    <summary>Impact of the `near` plane on the level of detail / performance.</summary>

The `near` plane greatly affects the depth buffer resolution (the level of detail). For performance reasons, it is recommended to keep the near plane as far as possible (default is `0.1m`).
The table below shows how the precision drops for various `near` plane values (smaller values are better).

 | near (m) | 1 m    | 10 m   | 100 m  | 1 Km   |
 |----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
 | 0.001    | 7.2e-5 | 0.0043 | 0.4624 | 48.58  |
 | 0.01     | 6.9e-6 | 0.0001 | 0.0430 | 4.62   |
 | 0.1      | 3.6e-7 | 7.0e-5 | 0.0072 | 0.43   |
 | 1.0      | 0      | 3.8e-6 | 0.0007 | 0.07   |
 
 </details>

#### `far` plane

- The farthest distance from the camera at which objects will be rendered
- Objects farther from the camera than the far plane are clipped and not displayed
- Default is `100m`

## The camera manipulator

The camera can be controlled by a helper utility called [`CameraManipulator`](../api/interfaces/CameraManipulator), which enables complex gestures such as orbiting, panning, and zooming.

Currently only a `ORBIT` mode is supported (in the future `MAP` and `FREE_FLIGHT` could be added as well).

This shows how to implement a simple camera manipulator, for the full example see the [CameraPan example](https://github.com/margelo/react-native-filament/blob/main/package/example/Shared/src/CameraPan.tsx):

```tsx
import { Camera, useCameraManipulator } from 'react-native-filament'
import { Gesture } from 'react-native-gesture-handler'

const cameraManipulator = useCameraManipulator({
  orbitHomePosition: [0, 0, 8], // "Camera location"
  targetPosition: [0, 0, 0], // "Looking at"
  orbitSpeed: [0.003, 0.003],
})

const panGesture = Gesture.Pan()
  .onBegin((event) => {
    const yCorrected = viewHeight - event.translationY
    cameraManipulator?.grabBegin(event.translationX, yCorrected, false) // false means rotation instead of translation
  })
  .onUpdate((event) => {
    const yCorrected = viewHeight - event.translationY
    cameraManipulator?.grabUpdate(event.translationX, yCorrected)
  })
  .onEnd(() => {
    cameraManipulator?.grabEnd()
  })

return <Camera cameraManipulator={cameraManipulator} />
```
